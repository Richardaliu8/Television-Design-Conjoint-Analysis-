# Television-Design-Conjoint-Analysis-

Project Overview  
This project focuses on the application of linear regression within a conjoint analysis framework to solve a business problem related to new product design. Specifically, it involves designing a range of flat-panel TVs by analyzing consumer preferences.

Features  
Conjoint Analysis: Utilizes conjoint analysis to determine how different attributes of products, such as screen size, resolution, brand, and price, affect consumer preferences.  
Preference Ranking: Implements a methodical preference ranking system where product profiles are divided into categories (very good, good, average, below average) and assigned a reverse rank ordered vector to accurately capture consumer preferences.  
Regression Analysis: Applies linear regression to analyze how individual product attributes influence consumer choices, determining the partworths of each attribute.  
Function Design: Develops a custom R function to automate the calculation of key metrics such as partworths, attribute importance, willingness to pay, optimal price, maximum profit, and market share.  
Optimal Product Configuration: Identifies the optimal combination of product attributes that maximizes both consumer appeal and profitability.  
Visual Insights: Includes plots of market share and profit as functions of price, providing a clear visual representation of pricing strategy effectiveness.

Purpose  
The purpose of this project is to equip business analysts and product managers with a robust analytical tool to design products that align closely with consumer preferences and market dynamics. By understanding and applying the insights from conjoint analysis, companies can strategically position their products to enhance market penetration and profitability.
